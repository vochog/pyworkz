How It Works:

HTML: Defines the structure with a container (.unbox-container), a lid (.box-lid), a base (.box-base), and the PlayStation image (.console).

CSS: Styles the elements and sets up the initial positions. The .box-lid and .box-base are positioned absolutely within the container, and the .console image is initially hidden with opacity: 0.

JavaScript (GSAP): Utilizes the GSAP library with the ScrollTrigger plugin to animate the lid's movement and the console's opacity based on the scroll position.

2. Add an Image: Place a PlayStation image named playstation.png in the same directory as your HTML file.


3. Open in Browser: Open the index.html file in a web browser and scroll down to see the unboxing effect.
